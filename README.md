# FlowMetricsforCLI
It's a bunch of flow metrics tools for command line enthousiasts

## What works so far
- Test data generation
- Monte Carlo: How Much
- Monte Carlo: How Many
- Service Level Expectations
- Custom test data generation

## What's next?
- Setting custom variables for the forecasts
- Data parsing
- Custom throughput picking algorithm selection for the MC simulations
- Something TUI maybe somewhere down the line. Might possibly be another project though.
- Probably code optimizations as I learn more. 

## QA
Q: Why do this? 

A: Because I wanted to teach myself Golang and thought this would be something fun to do. I also find it helps in teaching if you can just show people how flow metrics work in code.

Q: This code is pretty awful...

A: I know. Learning project.

Q: Why the command line though?

A: There's already a perfectly fine visual suite available at 55degrees, called Actionable Agile. They can go Electron with that if they want. I wanted something that can plug into whatever and runs locally.

Q: What are these "Flow Metrics" of which you speak?

A: Probabilistic forecasting math for people that figured out that you can't really estimate work to an exact degree. I co-wrote a book on it, you can get it [here](https://leanpub.com/flowmetricsforscrumteams). Prokanban.org also has some good classes on the topic, for [Scrum Teams](https://prokanban.org/applying-flow-metrics-for-scrum/) and [everyone else](https://prokanban.org/applying-metrics-for-predictability/).
